To Start MySQL Server:
# mysql
mysql> create database reva;
mysql> show databases;
mysql> use reva;
mysql> create table employee ( name varchar(25), age int);
mysql> insert into employee values (“e1”,21);
mysql> insert into employee values (“e2”,22);
mysql> exit;
#.....(The MySQL server is now started and a database along with a table called “employee” is ready for use).

Apache Http Server:
The web server we are using here is Apache Http Server. It is freely downloadable from the site www.apache.org.
Once you have downloaded the installer, double click on that and install it in to your system.
Then click on start to start your server. Then open an Internet explorer and type http://localhost:80/.
The port number 80 is optional in the URL.
